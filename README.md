### 21300506_hw7.c
Input file for above graph is named as ‘hw7.data’ and available at hisnet. Input file
represents data in adjacency matrix form as in hw6. (There are white spaces – such as
tab or space – between data.) Assume number of nodes in your graph is less than or
equal to 30. Program outline is as follows.
Read input file
* Create array of adjacency list for a given graph    
* Apply Dijkstra's algorithm for |V| times and print result       
* Run Floyd’s algorithm and print result
